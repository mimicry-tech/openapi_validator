# OpenAPIv3Validator

A small library for validating OpenAPI specs independently of the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io) - and independently of JavaScript.

Originally extracted from a branch of [mimicry](https://github.com/mimicry-tech/mimicry) as this might be useful to others.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `openapi_validator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:openapiv3_validator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/openapi_validator](https://hexdocs.pm/openapi_validator).
